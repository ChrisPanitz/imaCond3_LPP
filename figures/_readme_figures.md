Figure2_barplotFear:
bar plots (means & SEMs based on within-participant variance) of fear ratings at the end of acquisition, separate for conditioning groups and CS types

Figure3_barPlot_SCR:
bar plot (means & SEMs based on within-participant variance) of CS-evoked SCR avered across all acquisition trials, separate for conditioning groups and CS types; normalized according to Lykken & Venables (1971)

Figure4_timeCourses_barPlot_IBI
- time courses of CS-evoked IBI responses (-1 to 7 s; baseline-corrected), averaged across all acquisition trials separate for conditioning groups and CS types
- bar plot (means & SEMs based on within-participant variance; mean amplitude in preregistered time window: 2 to 5 s) of CS-evoked IBI averaged across all acquisition trials, separate for conditioning groups and CS types

Figure4b_timeCourses_barPlot_IBI_exploratory
- time courses of CS-evoked IBI responses (-1 to 7 s; baseline-corrected), averaged across all acquisition trials separate for conditioning groups and CS types
- bar plot (means & SEMs based on within-participant variance; mean amplitude in exploratory time window: 4 to 7 s) of CS-evoked IBI averaged across all acquisition trials, separate for conditioning groups and CS types

Figure5_timeCourse_barPlot_LPP
- time courses of CS-evoked ERPs at Pz (-200 to 1000 ms; averaged-mastoids reference), averaged across all acquisition trials separate for conditioning groups and CS types
- bar plot (means & SEMs based on within-participant variance; mean amplitude for preregistered time window & channel: 300 to 700 ms at Pz) of CS-evoked LPP averaged across all acquisition trials, separate for conditioning groups and CS types
- topography for the contrast comparing CS+aversive [weight: 1] against the average of CS+neutral [-0.5] and CS- [-0.5], using mean amplitude from 300 to 700 ms
