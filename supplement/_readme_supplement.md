statistics and plots from supplementary analyses

For the analyses including factor Time, file names include: 
- the dependent variable: fearRating, scr, ibi, lpp, theta
- the included sample: ima = within imagery-based conditioning group, real = classical conditioning, acrossGroups = across all participants
- the output: anovaBayes = Bayes Factors for ANOVA models, anovaFreq = results from frequentist ANOVA, BFInclusion = Inclusion Bayes Factors, plot = line plot with means & SEMs, tTable = results from Bayesian & frequentist t-tests

For analyses in contingency-aware participants, there are docx-files containing result from t-tests for all pairwise comparisons:
- 01s_tableFear_aware_raw.docx
- 02s_tableSCR_aware_raw.docx
- 03s_tableIBI_aware_raw.docx
- 04s_tableLPP_aware_raw.docx

For main analyses on unpleasantness, arousal, anger, and disgust ratings, there are docx-files containing result from t-tests for all pairwise comparisons:
- t_table_Unpleasant.docx
- t_table_Arousal.docx
- t_table_Anger.docx
- t_table_Disgust.docx

In addition, there are:
- 04s_tableLPP_exploratory_raw.docx: t-test statistics for LPP with exploratory channel selection and time window
- 05s_theta_topographies.pdf: Topograohies for power density in the theta band
- Figure5b_timeCourse_barPlot_LPP_exploratory.pdf/eps: time courses, bar plots and topographies of LPP amplitudes for exploratory channel selection and time window
- FigureSupp_barplototherRatings.pdf/eps: bar plots for unpleasantness, arousal, anger, and disgust ratings
